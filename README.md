# block-create-bucket-without-tags
Small project that shows how Amazon Eventbridge can help you enhance control of you Amazon S3 buckets by blocking users to create buckets without tags. This project captures the bucket creation event and verify if the required tags are in place and deletes the bucket if they are not.
